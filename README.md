# Plotlyte
Plotlyte is made in python and currently can make 2 types of games:
- Plotlyte can function as a game engine for simple 2D games, based off Pygame. You will need to know Python to do this.
- Plotlyte can function as a text based adventure game engine/creator that uses JSON to make stories with branching paths.
If you are a non coder, or are a coder and want an easy framework to use, try this!
